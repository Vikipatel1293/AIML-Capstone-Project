# Abbrivio AI

Abbrivio AI is a text summarization web application that helps users to summarize text. It uses a fine-tuned BART model trained on a limited subset of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.

## Features

- Summarize text using a fine-tuned BART model.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework, PyTorch, Transformers
- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js
- npm
- virtualenv

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Vikipatel1293/AIML-Capstone-Project.git
    cd abbrivio-ai/backend
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the Django application**:
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser  # Follow the prompts to create a superuser
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter the text you want to summarize in the provided input box.
3. Click the "Summarize" button to generate the summary.


## Additional Information

This project uses Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) for handling large files. Ensure that you have Git LFS installed to clone and work with this repository. Follow the instructions to install Git LFS from the [official website](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

Before using the fine-tuned BART model, an attempt was made to train a custom model using an encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention and bidirectional LSTM. If you have expertise in this area or have sufficient resources to train this model further, please feel free to contact me.

### Work in Progress

- This project is in progress to fine-tune the BART model properly due to a lack of compute resources.
- Suggestions to improve this project are welcome.
- Contact me if you need any documentation or help in setting up the project.
- Work is in progress for deployment and making it better.
